<h1>Leela Krishna -acts in a play</h1>
<h5 class="name">A Doll's House Act 1 by  Henrik Ibsen</h5>
<p>_[SCENE.â€”A room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not
extravagantly. At the back, a door to the right leads to the
entrance-hall, another to the left leads to Helmer's study. Between the
doors stands a piano. In the middle of the left-hand wall is a door,
and beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, arm-chairs
and a small sofa. In the right-hand wall, at the farther end, another
door; and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy
chairs and a rocking-chair; between the stove and the door, a small
table. Engravings on the walls; a cabinet with china and other small
objects; a small book-case with well-bound books. The floors are
carpeted, and a fire burns in the stove. It is winter._</p>
<p>_A bell rings in the hall; shortly afterwards the door is heard to
open. Enter NORA, humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in outdoor
dress and carries a number of parcels; these she lays on the table to
the right. She leaves the outer door open after her, and through it is
seen a PORTER who is carrying a Christmas Tree and a basket, which he
gives to the MAID who has opened the door.]_</p>
<h5 class="name NORA">NORA.</h5>
<p class="speech">Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not see it until this evening, when it is dressed.</p>
<p class="direction"> _[To the PORTER, taking out her purse.]_</p> 
<p class="speech">How much?</p>
<h5 class="name">PORTER.</h5>
<p class="speech">Sixpence.</p>
<h5 class="name NORA">NORA.</h5>
<p class="speech">There is a shilling. No, keep the change.</p>
<p class="direction">_[The PORTER thanks her, and goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes
off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband's door and listens.]_</p> 
<p class="speech">Yes, he is in.</p>
<p class="direction">_[Still humming, she goes to the table on the right.]_</p>
<h5 class="name HELMAR">HELMER.</h5>
<p class="direction">_[calls out from his room]_.</p>
<p class="speech">Is that my little lark twittering out there?</p>
<h5 class="name NORA">NORA.</h5>
<p class="direction">_[busy opening some of the parcels]_.</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, it is!</p>
<h5 class="name HELMAR">HELMER.</h5>
<p class="speech">Is it my little squirrel bustling about?</p>
<h5 class="name NORA">NORA.</h5>
<p class="speech">Yes!</p>
<h5 class="name HELMAR">HELMER.</h5>
<p class="speech">When did my squirrel come home?</p>
<h5 class="name NORA">NORA.</h5>
<p class="speech">Just now. </p>
<p class="direction">_[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her mouth.]_</p>
<p class="speech">Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.</p>
<h5 class="name HELMAR">HELMER.</h5>
<p class="speech">Don't disturb me.</p>
<p class="direction">_[A little later, he opens the door and looks into the room, pen in hand.]_ </p>
<p class="speech">Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my little spendthrift been wasting money again?</p>
<h5 class="name NORA">NORA.</h5>
<p class="speech">Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little.This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.</p>
<h5 class="name HELMAR">HELMER.</h5>
<p class="speech">Still, you know, we can't spend money recklessly.</p>

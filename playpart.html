<h1>Leela Krishna -acts in a play</h1>
<h5>A Doll's House Act 1 by  Henrik Ibsen</h5>
<p>_[SCENE.â€”A room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not
extravagantly. At the back, a door to the right leads to the
entrance-hall, another to the left leads to Helmer's study. Between the
doors stands a piano. In the middle of the left-hand wall is a door,
and beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, arm-chairs
and a small sofa. In the right-hand wall, at the farther end, another
door; and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy
chairs and a rocking-chair; between the stove and the door, a small
table. Engravings on the walls; a cabinet with china and other small
objects; a small book-case with well-bound books. The floors are
carpeted, and a fire burns in the stove. It is winter._</p>
<p>_A bell rings in the hall; shortly afterwards the door is heard to
open. Enter NORA, humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in outdoor
dress and carries a number of parcels; these she lays on the table to
the right. She leaves the outer door open after her, and through it is
seen a PORTER who is carrying a Christmas Tree and a basket, which he
gives to the MAID who has opened the door.]_</p>
<h5>NORA.</h5>
Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not
see it until this evening, when it is dressed.<p> _[To the PORTER, taking
out her purse.]_</p> How much?
<h5>PORTER.</h5>
<p>Sixpence.</p>
<h5>NORA.</h5>
<p>There is a shilling. No, keep the change. <p>_[The PORTER thanks her, and
goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes
off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket
and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband's door and
listens.]_</p> Yes, he is in. <p>_[Still humming, she goes to the table on the
right.]_</p>
<h5>HELMER.</h5>
<p>_[calls out from his room]_.</p> <p>Is that my little lark twittering out there?</p>
<h5>NORA.</h5>
<p>_[busy opening some of the parcels]_.</p> <p>Yes, it is!</p>
<h5>HELMER.</h5>
<p>Is it my little squirrel bustling about?</p>
<h5>NORA.</h5>
<p>Yes!</p>
<h5>HELMER.</h5>
<p>When did my squirrel come home?</p>
<h5>NORA.</h5>
<p>Just now. </p><p>_[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
mouth.]_</p> <p>Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.</p>
<h5>HELMER.</h5>
<p>Don't disturb me. </p><p>_[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
the room, pen in hand.]_ </p><p>Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
little spendthrift been wasting money again?</p>
<h5>NORA.</h5>
<p>Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little.
This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.</p>
<h5>HELMER.</h5>
<p>Still, you know, we can't spend money recklessly.</p>
